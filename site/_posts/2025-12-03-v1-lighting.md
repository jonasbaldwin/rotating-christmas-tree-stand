**I am NOT a licenced electrician. Take my advice at your own risk.**

I'd been dreaming of building a rotating Christmas tree stand for a couple years and in 2022 I finally resolved to do it. 

The first question people ask is, "how do you keep the lights from getting tanged?" and honestly, that was the easiest part of the project to solve.

![Image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/slip-ring.jpg){: .medium .float-left} A [slip ring](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=slip+ring&i=tools) is a device that spins, there are a few wires coming out of the bottom and a few coming out of the top. The wires are color coordinated, so if you cut an extention cord in half and hook them up to the slip ring on both ends you effectively have an extention cord that can spin without getting tangled.

![Image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/end-of-plug.jpeg){: .medium .float-right} You can get [slip rings](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=slip+ring&i=tools) from anywhere that sell electronics. It's important, however, to make sure you get a large enough gauge for the wires you're using (I just tried to match the cord's wire gauge).

I have found it is very useful to have a table with the different colors. The table should have a column for the colors of the wires in the extention cord and the slip ring, but I also found it helpful to use the lables on the extention cord itself (if you look at the ends of the ends of the extention cord there may be letters and symbols, my extention cord only had it on one end, but using a multi-meter it was pretty easy to tell what the labels should be on the other side).

My table looks something like this:

| plug | extention cord | slip ring |
|---|---|---|
| ⏚ | green | red |
| N | black | black |
| L | white | yellow |

When I first connected the wires I used wingnuts. This worked the first two years, but even though I ensured a good connection and fastened it with electrical tape it failed year three and I had to do some repairs on the wiring. I upgraded to using Solder Seal Wire Connectors which has been better.

As far as I can see there is no reason I couldn't use an AC plug (rather than having an extention cord sticking out the top) so that is part of my plan for v2.
