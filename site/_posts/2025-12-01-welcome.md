Welcome to my progress log! I'm documenting my journey building version 2 of my rotating Christmas tree stand.

I'll start by writing about the first version and the pros and cons of its design. I'll also write about a few things that I want to improve including:
- Bidirectional rotation
- Remote control capability
- Water level sensors
- And more...

Stay tuned for updates as I work through the design and build process.

In my next post I'll talk about how I made the lights work (without getting everything tangled).
