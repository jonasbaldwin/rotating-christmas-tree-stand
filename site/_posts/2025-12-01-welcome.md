Welcome to my progress log! I'm documenting my journey building version 2 of my rotating Christmas tree stand.

This time around, I'm planning to add some exciting new features:
- Bidirectional rotation
- Remote control capability
- Water level sensors
- And more...

Stay tuned for updates as I work through the design and build process.
