In the last post I talked about how I got the lights to work on the rotating Christmas tree stand, but how did I actually get it to spin a _live_ tree?

When I was doing research, the only rotating tree stands I could find were for artificial trees. I'm not against artifical trees, but my family really like having a live tree, so it was important that we could have a full size, live tree.

So how did I get it to spin?

![Underside of rotating base moving wheel]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wheel-rotation.jpeg){: .medium .float-left} Like everything else, this took some trial and error. I initially wanted to have a rubber wheel spinning in contact with the rotating part of the stand. It worked, but not very well. It slipped a lot and sometimes stopped altogether. By this point, it was already early October and I only had a few months to go before I needed to use the tree.

![Tree stand in the process of being assembled with 3D printed gears]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/v1-gears.jpeg){: .medium .float-right} I needed a more reliable solution so I opted to 3D print gears which I used a motor to drive. 

This solution was much better, though there were still a few challenges:
- it still sometimes got stuck (it's better with a little lubrication)
- the assembly is a lot more complicated (with a lot of bolts)
- it also took a LOT of fillament. I printed them with 100% infil, (that might be overkill for most projects, but I felt that it was necessary here since they needed to be able to handle a lot of weight)

Another problem I needed to solve was how to make it so that the tree would spin without too much friction. For this I used a [lazy susan](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076VJ6V41). I built a base for the lazy suzan that was about the height of the slip ring (so that it would funciton correctly) and then attached the lazy susan on top of that. It needed to be a pretty heavy duty one (most 7 foot trees weight 50-70 lbs) and the one I got worked perfectly. You can see the lazy susan in both pictures (behind the wheel on top of the base and on the inner side of the gears).

The gears have held up pretty good, but I want to make some improvements in v2. I want the teeth to point inwards, and I'm going to experiment with double helical gears (to make it quieter and provided some torque benefits).
