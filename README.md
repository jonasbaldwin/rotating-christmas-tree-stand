# rotating-christmas-tree-stand
Make your live holiday tree even better by continually rotating it.

## How It Started

I spent 2022 making a rotating Christmas tree stand in my spare time. I didn't know what I was doing, and it took the whole year to get something functional. It's now 2025 and I'm actively planning version 2.

## How It's Going

### December 2025

I've spent the last few days making new plans and have decided I'll log my progress here.

Version Features Sneek Peek:
- turn in both directions
- remote control
- water level sensors

Check back soon and I'll have an update for you.
